## Overview

The attestation system provides cryptographic proof of AI actions, decisions, and outcomes. This enables verifiable AI behavior and creates an audit trail for accountability and trust.

## Attestation Structure

### Core Fields
```json
{
  "id": "attestation_unique_id",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "signer": "entity_identifier",
  "signature": "cryptographic_signature",
  "content": {
    "action": "ai_decision_or_action",
    "context": "surrounding_conditions",
    "outcome": "result_or_consequence",
    "metadata": "additional_information"
  },
  "proof": {
    "merkle_root": "root_of_verification_tree",
    "witnesses": ["witness_1", "witness_2"],
    "nonce": "replay_protection_nonce"
  }
}
```

### Signature Requirements
- **Algorithm**: Ed25519 or ECDSA P-256
- **Key Management**: Hardware security modules preferred
- **Rotation**: Regular key rotation required
- **Verification**: Public key infrastructure

## Attestation Types

### AI Decision Attestations
Record when AI systems make decisions:
- Decision rationale
- Input data used
- Confidence levels
- Alternative options considered
- Human oversight involved

### Action Attestations
Record when AI systems take actions:
- Action description
- Target systems affected
- Expected outcomes
- Risk assessment
- Mitigation measures

### Outcome Attestations
Record the results of AI actions:
- Actual outcomes
- Performance metrics
- Error conditions
- Lessons learned
- Improvement recommendations

### Integrity Attestations
Record system integrity checks:
- System state verification
- Data integrity confirmation
- Security posture assessment
- Compliance verification
- Audit trail validation

## Verification Process

### Cryptographic Verification
1. **Signature Validation**: Verify the digital signature
2. **Key Validation**: Confirm the signing key is valid
3. **Timestamp Verification**: Check for replay attacks
4. **Nonce Validation**: Ensure uniqueness

### Content Verification
1. **Schema Validation**: Verify against JSON schema
2. **Logic Validation**: Check for internal consistency
3. **Context Validation**: Verify against known context
4. **Outcome Validation**: Confirm actual results

### Chain Verification
1. **Merkle Tree**: Verify inclusion in proof tree
2. **Witness Validation**: Confirm witness signatures
3. **Chain Integrity**: Verify no tampering
4. **Consensus Check**: Confirm community agreement

## Privacy Considerations

### Data Minimization
