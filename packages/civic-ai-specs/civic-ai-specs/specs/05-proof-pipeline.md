- Metadata inclusion
- Timestamp verification
- Nonce generation

### 2. Proof Validation
- Signature verification
- Content validation
- Timestamp checking
- Nonce verification
- Chain validation

### 3. Proof Storage
- Immutable storage
- Distributed replication
- Access control
- Backup and recovery
- Archival management

### 4. Proof Verification
- Public verification
- Community validation
- Expert review
- Automated checking
- Dispute resolution

  "decision": {
    "input": "decision_input_data",
    "process": "decision_making_process",
    "output": "decision_result",
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "alternatives": ["alternative_1", "alternative_2"]
  },
  "proof": {
    "signature": "cryptographic_signature",
