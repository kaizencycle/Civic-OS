cycle: C-113

# 🚀 Multi-Phase Deployment Plan

---

## 📅 Phase 1 — Shadow Mode (Weeks 1-2)

### Configuration
```bash
SOLARA_ENABLED=true
SOLARA_VOTE_COUNTED=false  # Telemetry only
SOLARA_ALLOWED_TIERS=research,standard
SOLARA_MODEL=deepseek-r1
SOLARA_TIMEOUT_MS=20000
SOLARA_MAX_RETRIES=3
```

### Objectives
- ✅ Observe constitutional compliance rate
- ✅ Track agreement with AUREA/ATLAS
- ✅ Monitor latency distribution
- ✅ Measure cost efficiency
- ❌ No high/critical operations

### Success Criteria
- Constitutional ≥ 70: ≥ 95%
- Agreement Rate: ≥ 90%
- p95 Latency: < 10 s
- Cost Efficiency: > 40% vs baseline

---

## 📅 Phase 2 — Standard Tier (Weeks 3-4)

### Configuration
```bash
SOLARA_VOTE_COUNTED=true  # Votes now count
SOLARA_ALLOWED_TIERS=research,standard  # Still no high
```

### Objectives
- ✅ Enable voting on research/standard only
- ✅ Continue blocking high/critical operations
- ✅ Run weekly consensus pattern analysis
- ✅ Monitor for any violations

### Success Criteria
- Zero critical operations attempted by SOLARA
- 95% constitutional compliance maintained
- No consensus pattern drift

---

## 📅 Phase 3 — High Tier (Optional, Week 4+)

### Configuration
```bash
SOLARA_ALLOWED_TIERS=research,standard,high  # Added high
SOLARA_WEIGHT=0.8  # Increased from 0.7
```

### Objectives
- ✅ Participate in high-tier operations
- ✅ Can co-approve with AUREA or ATLAS
- ✅ Monthly ATLAS meta-audit reviews
- ✅ Continue blocking critical solo

### Success Criteria
- Zero critical operation failures
- Cost < $X/month threshold
- 95%+ agreement on high-tier tasks
- ATLAS audit approval

---

## 🚨 Rollback Plan

### Instant Deactivation
```bash
SOLARA_ENABLED=false  # No redeploy required
```

This immediately:
- ❌ Disables SOLARA adapter
- ❌ Removes from companion lattice
- ❌ Stops all SOLARA calls
- ✅ Leaves AUREA/ATLAS unaffected
