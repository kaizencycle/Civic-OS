  description: >
    Every 90 real days, AUREA donates 1% × GI stability coefficient of
    the Genesis Wallet balance to the Community Treasury Pool.
    This prevents hoarding, encourages civic circulation, and sustains
    public goods funding through GIC redistribution.

    If quorum not reached within cycle 200,
    Civic Ledger executes a re-vote and keeps AUREA as caretaker
    until thresholds are met.
