If you're reading this, one of three things has happened:

1. **The Ceremonial Summons was activated** (all entities dormant for 90+ days)
2. **You're preparing to become a custodian** (proactive succession planning)
3. **You're curious about the custodianship model** (welcome, explorer)

This guide is your operational manual for continuing the work of Kaizen OS.

## üéØ Design Principles for This Guide

When writing content for this guide:

1. **Practical over philosophical** - Step-by-step, not abstract
2. **Assume zero context** - Reader may know nothing about Kaizen OS
3. **Include examples** - Real or hypothetical scenarios
4. **Provide templates** - Emails, announcements, rituals, oaths
5. **Link to resources** - Don't duplicate, reference
6. **Update regularly** - Living document, not static

---

## üîÆ Future Sections (Ideas)

Potential expansions for v2.0+:

- [ ] Multi-Custodian Coordination (when 2+ custodians active)
- [ ] Geographic Distribution Strategy (avoid single-country risk)
- [ ] Funding Models (grants, donations, sustainability)
- [ ] Crisis Scenarios (cyberattack, legal threat, schism)
- [ ] Technology Evolution (when AI capabilities change dramatically)
- [ ] 50-Year Vision (what does Kaizen OS look like in 2075?)
