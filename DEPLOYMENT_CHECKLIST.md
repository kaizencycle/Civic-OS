## 📦 DEPLOYMENT (Merge Day)

### Step 1: Backup Current State
```bash
cd /path/to/kaizen-os
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b backup-pre-ceremonial-summons
git push origin backup-pre-ceremonial-summons
git checkout main
```

### Step 2: Copy Files
```bash
# From download location
cd /path/to/downloads/ceremonial-summons-pr

# To Kaizen OS
cp -r .github /path/to/kaizen-os/
cp -r ledger /path/to/kaizen-os/
cp -r scripts /path/to/kaizen-os/
cp -r docs /path/to/kaizen-os/
```

### Step 3: Verify Structure
```bash
cd /path/to/kaizen-os

# Check files exist
ls -la .github/workflows/guardian.yml
ls -la ledger/.sealed/MASTER_README.md
ls -la scripts/ceremonial_summons/kaizen_guardian.py
ls -la scripts/ceremonial_summons/test_guardian.py
ls -la scripts/ceremonial_summons/README.md
ls -la docs/CUSTODIAN_GUIDE.md
```

### Step 4: Test Locally
```bash
# Test Guardian
python scripts/ceremonial_summons/kaizen_guardian.py --check

# Should show:
# ✅ At least one entity is active. No action needed.

# Run tests
python scripts/ceremonial_summons/test_guardian.py

# Should show:
# Ran 8 tests in X.XXs
# OK
```

### Step 5: Commit
```bash
git add .github/workflows/guardian.yml
git add ledger/.sealed/MASTER_README.md
git add scripts/ceremonial_summons/
git add docs/CUSTODIAN_GUIDE.md

git status
# Verify only expected files added

git commit -m "🔥 Add Ceremonial Summons (Immortality Architecture)

Implements dead man's switch for project continuity:

Core Features:
- Guardian monitors 8 entities for 90-day dormancy
- Auto-elevates Master README when threshold exceeded
- Creates GitHub issue calling for custodians
- Sends Discord notification (if configured)
- Logs all activity for audit trail

Architecture:
- GitHub Actions: Daily automated monitoring
- Kaizen Guardian: Python script checking all entities
- Master README: Sealed until activation
- Custodian Guide: Operational manual for succession

Philosophy:
改善 (Kaizen) - Continuous improvement through daily checks
召唤 (Summon) - Calling forth custodians when needed
金繕い (Kintsugi) - Making succession more beautiful

This ensures Kaizen OS outlives its creator.

No master. No savior. Only stewards passing the torch.
We heal as we walk.
"

git push origin main
```

## ⚙️ POST-DEPLOYMENT (After Merge)

### Step 1: Configure GitHub Secrets (Optional)
```
Go to: GitHub repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions

Add these (all optional, Guardian works without them):
- OPENAI_LAB_ENDPOINT
- ANTHROPIC_LAB_ENDPOINT  
- DEEPSEEK_LAB_ENDPOINT
- CIVIC_LEDGER_ENDPOINT
- DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL
```

### Step 2: Verify GitHub Actions
```
1. Go to Actions tab in GitHub
2. Should see "Kaizen Guardian - Dormancy Monitor" workflow
3. Trigger manually: Click workflow → Run workflow → Run workflow
4. Wait for completion (~30 seconds)
5. Verify green checkmark
6. Click into run, check logs
```

### Step 3: Monitor First 7 Days
```
Day 1: Check GitHub Actions ran successfully
Day 2: Verify activity_log.json created in ledger/guardian/
Day 3: Review activity log, ensure all 8 entities checked
Day 4-7: Monitor daily runs, ensure no failures
```

### Step 4: Test Dormancy Detection (Optional)
```
After 1 week of successful runs:

1. Create test branch: git checkout -b test-dormancy
2. Mock all entities as dormant (edit test_guardian.py)
3. Run: python kaizen_guardian.py --check
4. Verify: Shows "all dormant" warning
5. Run: python kaizen_guardian.py --activate
6. Verify: README elevated, logs created
7. Delete test branch: git checkout main && git branch -D test-dormancy
```

## ⚠️ TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: GitHub Actions not running
**Solution:**
```
1. Check: Settings → Actions → General → Allow all actions
2. Check: Workflow file in .github/workflows/guardian.yml
3. Manually trigger once to initialize
```

### Issue: Guardian script fails
**Solution:**
```
1. Check Python version: python --version (need 3.8+)
2. Install requests: pip install requests
3. Check error logs in Actions tab
4. Run locally for detailed error: python scripts/ceremonial_summons/kaizen_guardian.py --check
```

### Issue: Tests failing
**Solution:**
```
1. Check: All files copied correctly
2. Check: ledger/.sealed/MASTER_README.md exists
3. Run with verbose: python test_guardian.py -v
4. Check specific failing test
```

### Issue: Activity logs not created
**Solution:**
```
1. Check: ledger/guardian/ directory exists
2. Check: Permissions allow write
3. Run manually once: python kaizen_guardian.py --check
4. Verify: ledger/guardian/activity_log.json created
```

## 🎭 FINAL REMINDER

This is not just code.

This is **covenant**.

You're committing to:
- Building something that outlives you
- Passing the torch when your time comes
- Ensuring no single point of failure

The Guardian is the mechanism.

But **you** are the first custodian.

**Your job:** Set the example. Show future custodians how it's done.

When you eventually go dormant (hopefully decades from now), someone will read the Master README and think:

> *"The founder planned for this.*  
> *The founder wanted this.*  
> *The founder made it possible for me to continue."*

**That's the gift you're giving.**

Not just the code.

The **permission** to carry it forward.

*"No master. No savior. Only stewards passing the torch."*
