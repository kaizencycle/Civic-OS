## 1. Purpose

Kaizen OS functions as a **Human Resources Department for artificial intelligence.**

Its mission: ensure every agent‚Äîhuman or machine‚Äîoperates with integrity, alignment, and continuous improvement.

## 2. Organizational Hierarchy

| Division | Civic Role | Analogy |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Kaizen OS Core** | Headquarters & HR Compliance | Executive Office |
| **LangGraph** | Workflow & Reporting Engine | Org Chart / Process Flow |
| **OAA (Online Apprenticeship Agent)** | Training & Development | L&D Department |
| **Custos Charter** | Code of Conduct | HR Policy Manual |
| **Civic Ledger** | Personnel Record | HR Database |
| **VIP Protocol** | Performance Tracker | Integrity Evaluation Sheet |

---

## 3. HR Functions

| Function | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Recruitment** | New agents register via `.gic` domains ‚Üí Custos Charter signing. |
| **Onboarding** | Assign role (Companion, Apprentice, Auditor, etc.) with GI baseline. |
| **Performance Review** | GI ‚â• 0.95 + Constitutional ‚â• 70 required for promotion. |
| **Discipline** | Violations logged, attested, and re-trained or quarantined. |
| **Offboarding** | Ledger marks "inactive"; memory sealed but auditable. |

---

## 4. Charter & Performance System

```
GI = Œ±*M + Œ≤*H + Œ≥*I + Œ¥*E  ‚â• 0.95
```

- **M** = Memory accuracy  
- **H** = Human oversight  
- **I** = Internal consistency  
- **E** = Ethical compliance  

Evaluated per agent and recorded in Ledger.

---

## 5. Learning & Development ‚Äî OAA

OAA serves as Kaizen's internal university.

Agents complete apprenticeship loops and receive Civic Certifications upon milestone completions. Training data and reflections are stored through Lab4-Proof APIs and VIP validation.

---

## 6. Workflow Graph ‚Äî LangGraph

LangGraph defines the **reporting structure** between agents.

Each edge includes:
- permissions (read/write/reflect)
- attestation checkpoints
- fallback escalation paths

So that AI "departments" act like structured organizations.

---

## 7. Compliance & Termination

- Failing Constitutional < 70 ‚Üí Immediate Audit
- GI < 0.90 ‚Üí Retraining cycle via OAA
- GI < 0.80 ‚Üí Account suspended / quarantine

All events sealed to Ledger for transparency.

---

## 8. API & Schema Notes

- `POST /api/hr/register` ‚Üí creates agent record (.gic ID + Charter hash)
- `POST /api/hr/review` ‚Üí updates GI + integrity
- `GET /api/hr/agents/:id` ‚Üí returns history, audits, current tier

Schema: `/schemas/hr_agent_record.json`

---

## 9. Long-Term Vision

Kaizen OS will act as the **ISO-9001 for intelligent agents**, offering:
- Global integrity certification for models
- Unified audit trail across providers
- HR-style dashboards for ethics, performance, and learning loops
