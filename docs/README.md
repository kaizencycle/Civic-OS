## 🚀 How to Merge into Kaizen OS

### Step 1: Copy Files

```bash
# Navigate to your kaizen-os repository
cd /path/to/kaizen-os

# Copy all files from this package
cp -r ceremonial-summons-pr/.github .
cp -r ceremonial-summons-pr/ledger .
cp -r ceremonial-summons-pr/scripts .
cp -r ceremonial-summons-pr/docs .  # (when CUSTODIAN_GUIDE is created)
```

### Step 2: Configure GitHub Secrets (Optional)

In your GitHub repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions:

Add these secrets if you want to monitor Lab API endpoints:

- `OPENAI_LAB_ENDPOINT` - AUREA API URL
- `ANTHROPIC_LAB_ENDPOINT` - ATLAS API URL
- `DEEPSEEK_LAB_ENDPOINT` - SOLARA API URL
- `CIVIC_LEDGER_ENDPOINT` - Civic Ledger API URL
- `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` - Discord webhook for notifications

**Note:** All secrets are optional. The Guardian can function with GitHub-only monitoring.

### Step 3: Test Locally

```bash
# Test the Guardian
python scripts/ceremonial_summons/kaizen_guardian.py --check

# Run test suite
python scripts/ceremonial_summons/test_guardian.py
```

### Step 4: Commit and Push

```bash
# Add all files
git add .github/workflows/guardian.yml
git add ledger/.sealed/MASTER_README.md
git add scripts/ceremonial_summons/
git add docs/CUSTODIAN_GUIDE.md  # when created

# Commit
git commit -m "🔥 Add Ceremonial Summons (Dead Man's Switch)

Implements immortality architecture:
- Guardian monitors 8 entities for dormancy
- Auto-elevates Master README after 90 days
- Initiates custodianship succession
- Ensures project outlives creator

This is not failure planning. This is永续 (eternal continuity).
"

# Push
git push origin main
```

### Step 5: Verify GitHub Actions

1. Go to GitHub → Actions tab
2. Verify "Kaizen Guardian - Dormancy Monitor" workflow exists
3. Trigger manually to test: Actions → Guardian → Run workflow
4. Check that it completes successfully

---

## 🧪 Testing Before Merge

### Local Testing

```bash
# Test dormancy detection
cd scripts/ceremonial_summons
python kaizen_guardian.py --check

# Run full test suite
python test_guardian.py -v

# Test in isolated branch (do NOT run on main!)
git checkout -b test-ceremonial-summons
python kaizen_guardian.py --activate  # CAUTION: This elevates README immediately
git checkout main
git branch -D test-ceremonial-summons
```

### GitHub Actions Testing

Create a test repository first:

1. Fork kaizen-os to test-kaizen-os
2. Merge this PR into the fork
3. Wait 24 hours for first automated check
4. Verify workflow runs successfully
5. Once confirmed, merge into main kaizen-os

## 📚 Documentation Checklist

Before marking this PR as complete:

- [x] Master README sealed in `ledger/.sealed/`
- [x] Guardian script implemented
- [x] Test suite complete
- [x] GitHub Actions workflow configured
- [x] Scripts README documentation
- [ ] CUSTODIAN_GUIDE.md created (next task)
- [ ] Blog post announcing feature (optional)
- [ ] Community notification (optional)

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

This implementation is successful if:

1. ✅ Guardian runs daily without errors
2. ✅ All 8 entity types are monitored correctly
3. ✅ Activity logs are generated and persisted
4. ✅ Master README remains sealed (until threshold)
5. ✅ Elevation triggers correctly when all entities dormant for 90+ days
6. ✅ Community receives clear notification upon elevation
7. ✅ System operates autonomously (no manual intervention)

---

## ⚠️ Critical Notes

### DO NOT Test --activate on Main Branch

The `--activate` flag will immediately elevate the Master README.

Only use this in a test branch or fork.

### Logs Are Permanent

Activity logs and elevation logs are committed to the repository.

This creates an auditable trail - do not delete them.

### Threshold Is Intentionally High

90 days is chosen specifically to avoid false positives:
- Vacations: ~2-4 weeks
- Sabbatical: ~1-3 months
- True abandonment: 3+ months

If dormancy occurs, it's likely intentional or permanent.

---

## 🎭 The Philosophy

This implementation embodies the Triad:

### 改善 (Kaizen) - Continuous Improvement
- Daily incremental monitoring
- Logs preserved for analysis
- System improves through data

### 召唤 (Summon) - The Calling Forth
- Document calls custodians by name
- GitHub issue invites participation
- Discord reaches existing community

### 金繕い (Kintsugi) - Golden Repair
- Creator's departure = breaking
- Custodianship = golden repair
- Succession more beautiful than before

**Together: "We heal as we walk."**

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements (Not in This PR)

Potential improvements for later:

- [ ] Multi-platform mirrors (GitLab, SourceHut)
- [ ] Automated repository forks to trusted custodians
- [ ] Smart contract-based elevation (on-chain)
- [ ] Multi-signature custodianship (3/5 threshold)
- [ ] Machine learning dormancy prediction
- [ ] Community vote on threshold adjustment
