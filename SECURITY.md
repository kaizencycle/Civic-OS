# Security Policy

## üîê Security at Kaizen OS

Security is a core principle of Kaizen OS. We are committed to maintaining the integrity and security of our platform and protecting our users.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Principles

Kaizen OS is built on three security pillars:

1. **Integrity First** - All operations maintain GI ‚â• 0.95 (Global Integrity)
2. **Defense in Depth** - Multiple security layers (Citizen Shield, attestations, monitoring)
3. **Transparency** - Open security practices and responsible disclosure

## üìä Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          | Notes                  |
| ------- | ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| 1.0.x   | ‚úÖ Yes             | Current stable release |
| 0.9.x   | ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited         | Critical fixes only    |
| < 0.9   | ‚ùå No              | Please upgrade         |

## üö® Reporting a Vulnerability

### Critical Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow responsible disclosure:

**DO NOT:**
- ‚ùå Open a public GitHub issue
- ‚ùå Discuss publicly before patch is available
- ‚ùå Exploit the vulnerability

**DO:**
1. ‚úÖ Email security contact: **security@kaizencycle.org** (or maintainer email)
2. ‚úÖ Include detailed description:
   - Vulnerability type (XSS, SQL injection, RCE, etc.)
   - Affected components/versions
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Proof of concept (if applicable)
   - Suggested fix (if you have one)
3. ‚úÖ Allow reasonable time for response (48-72 hours)
4. ‚úÖ Coordinate disclosure timeline with maintainers

### What to Expect

**Within 48 hours:**
- Acknowledgment of your report
- Initial assessment of severity

**Within 1 week:**
- Validation of the vulnerability
- Plan for fix and disclosure

**Within 2-4 weeks:**
- Security patch developed and tested
- Coordinated public disclosure

### Severity Levels

We follow CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System):

- **üî¥ Critical (9.0-10.0):** Immediate attention, emergency patch
- **üü† High (7.0-8.9):** Priority fix, patch within 1 week
- **üü° Medium (4.0-6.9):** Standard fix, patch within 2-4 weeks
- **üîµ Low (0.1-3.9):** Normal priority, patch in next release

### Bug Bounty

Currently, Kaizen OS does not have a formal bug bounty program. However:
- Valid security reports are acknowledged in release notes
- Contributors may receive recognition in Hall of Fame
- Future bug bounty program under consideration

## üîí Security Features

### Citizen Shield

Kaizen OS includes **Citizen Shield** (`apps/shield-api/`), which provides:

- **IDS/IPS:** Intrusion Detection and Prevention
- **2FA Support:** Two-factor authentication
- **Sandboxing:** Isolated execution environments
- **Policy-as-Code:** Kyverno/Gatekeeper integration
- **Rate Limiting:** Protection against abuse
- **Input Validation:** Request sanitization

### Integrity Monitoring

All services are monitored for integrity:

- **Health Checks:** `/healthz` and `/api/integrity-check` endpoints
- **GI Gates:** Operations blocked if GI < 0.95
- **Attestation Storage:** Immutable audit trail via Civic Ledger
- **Real-time Alerts:** Atlas Sentinel monitoring

### Authentication & Authorization

- **Environment-based secrets:** No hardcoded credentials
- **API key rotation:** Supported for external integrations
- **Service mesh security:** Mutual TLS between services
- **Least privilege:** Services have minimal required permissions

## üõ†Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

**Code Security:**
- Use parameterized queries (no SQL injection)
- Validate and sanitize all inputs
- Use secure dependencies (run `npm audit`)
- Avoid `eval()` or `exec()` with user input
- Implement proper error handling (no stack traces to users)

**Secrets Management:**
- Never commit secrets to repository
- Use environment variables or secrets managers
- Rotate credentials regularly
- Use `.env.local` for local development (gitignored)

**Dependencies:**
```bash
# Check for vulnerabilities
npm audit

# Fix automatically if possible
npm audit fix

# Review manual fixes
npm audit fix --force  # Use cautiously
```

### For Deployers

**Infrastructure Security:**
- Keep OS and dependencies updated
- Enable firewall (only necessary ports)
- Use HTTPS/TLS for all external traffic
- Enable logging and monitoring
- Implement backup and disaster recovery

**Environment Variables:**
```bash
# Required secure variables
CIVIC_OS_EXPORT_TOKEN=<secret>
DATABASE_URL=<secret>
API_KEYS=<secret>

# Security settings
NODE_ENV=production  # Never 'development' in prod
GI_MIN_THRESHOLD=0.95
SHIELD_ENABLED=true
```

### For Users

**Operational Security:**
- Keep your deployment updated
- Monitor integrity alerts
- Review audit logs regularly
- Report suspicious activity
- Use strong authentication

## üîç Security Audits

### Internal Audits

- **Quarterly:** Dependency vulnerability scans
- **Monthly:** Code security reviews
- **Weekly:** Integrity monitoring reports
- **Daily:** Automated security scans in CI/CD

### External Audits

- External security audit planned for v2.0 release
- Open to third-party security researchers
- Penetration testing welcome (with prior coordination)

## üöÄ Security Updates

### Notification Channels

Stay informed about security updates:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories:** Watch repository for alerts
2. **Release Notes:** Check CHANGELOG.md for security fixes
3. **GitHub Releases:** Security patches tagged with `security` label

### Applying Updates

```bash
# Pull latest security patches
git fetch origin
git pull origin main

# Update dependencies
npm install

# Rebuild services
npm run build

# Restart services
npm run compose:down
npm run compose:up
```
