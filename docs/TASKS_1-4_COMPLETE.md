   - Easy to develop and test separately
   - Clear separation of concerns

2. **Constitutional Framework**
   - 7-clause framework is comprehensive
   - GI scoring is measurable and actionable
   - Provides clear ethical guidelines

3. **Multi-LLM Approach**
   - Model-agnostic design future-proofs the system
   - No vendor lock-in
   - Democratic consensus reduces bias

4. **Economic Justification**
   - $2M+ ROI is compelling
   - Clear metrics (productivity, bugs, velocity)
   - C-suite ready presentation

### Areas for Enhancement

1. **Ledger Implementation**
   - Lab1 GI scoring is done, but Civic Ledger needs full blockchain implementation
   - Consider using existing framework (Substrate, Cosmos SDK)
   - Target: 4-6 weeks for production-ready ledger

2. **Model Cost Optimization**
   - Need intelligent model selection to reduce API costs
   - Implement caching for similar questions
   - Early termination on strong consensus
   - Target: 40% cost reduction

3. **Security Hardening**
   - Need full security audit before production
   - Implement rate limiting at multiple layers
   - Add DDoS protection
   - Target: Complete audit in Month 6

4. **Observability**
   - Need comprehensive monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana)
   - Distributed tracing (Jaeger)
   - Log aggregation (ELK stack)
   - Target: Deploy in Month 3
