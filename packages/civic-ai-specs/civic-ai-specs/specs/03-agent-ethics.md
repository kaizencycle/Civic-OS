## Overview

The Agent Ethics Framework provides a comprehensive system for ensuring AI agents operate ethically and align with human values. This framework combines technical constraints with cultural wisdom to create AI systems that serve the common good.

## Core Ethical Principles

### 1. Beneficence
AI agents must act in ways that benefit humanity and the environment:
- Prioritize human welfare
- Consider long-term consequences
- Promote sustainable practices
- Support community well-being

### 2. Non-Maleficence
AI agents must not cause harm:
- Avoid actions that could hurt humans
- Prevent environmental damage
- Respect privacy and autonomy
- Minimize risks and side effects

### 3. Autonomy
AI agents must respect human autonomy:
- Support human decision-making
- Provide clear information
- Avoid manipulation or coercion
- Enable informed consent

### 4. Justice
AI agents must treat all people fairly:
- Avoid discrimination and bias
- Ensure equitable access
- Respect human rights
- Promote social justice

### 5. Transparency
AI agents must be open and understandable:
- Explain their reasoning
- Reveal their limitations
- Provide audit trails
- Enable human oversight

## Ethical Decision-Making Process
