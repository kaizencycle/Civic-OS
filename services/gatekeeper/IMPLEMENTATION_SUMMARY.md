# Gatekeeper Implementation Summary

**Date**: October 31, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Complete

## Overview

Successfully implemented three critical security components for Citizen Shield (Lab 6) to protect against browser/model-injection attacks and other adversarial inputs:

1. **Gatekeeper Service** - FastAPI security gatekeeper
2. **DelibProof Consensus** - Multi-agent validation library

## 2. DelibProof Consensus Library ✅

**Location**: `shared/delibproof/`

### Components Created

- **Core Logic** (`core.py`)
  - Consensus verdict calculation
  - Threshold checking
  - Weighted consensus support

- **Sentinel Adapter** (`adapters/sentinel_http.py`)
  - HTTP client for sentinel endpoints
  - Async querying
  - Error handling (fail closed)

- **Local Rules** (`adapters/local_rules.py`)
  - Static rule-based checks
  - Quick RBAC validation
  - Pattern matching

### Features

✅ Multi-agent consensus  
✅ Configurable thresholds  
✅ Weighted voting support  
✅ Quick static checks  
✅ Fail-closed error handling  

---

## 3. Incident Response Runbook ✅

**Location**: `docs/runbooks/incident_response_citizen_shield.md`

### Sections

- **Roles & Responsibilities**: IC, Forensics, Comms, Ledger, SRE
- **Severity Matrix**: SEV-1/2/3 definitions
- **Golden Hour Protocol**: First 60 minutes response
- **24-Hour Investigation**: Timeline reconstruction
- **Recovery Procedures**: Deployment, GI checks, operations resume
- **Post-Mortem Template**: Documentation structure
- **Bounty & Compensation**: GIC rewards and penalties
- **Quick Reference**: Commands for common tasks

### Coverage

✅ Detection procedures  
✅ Isolation commands  
✅ Forensic capture  
✅ Secret rotation  
✅ Communications templates  
✅ Recovery checklists  
✅ Continuous improvement

## Next Steps

### Immediate (7-Day Sprint)

1. ✅ Deploy Gatekeeper service
2. ✅ Add DID signature requirement to all agents
3. ✅ Add GI check for privileged API calls
4. ✅ Add DelibProof gating for high-risk actions
5. ⏳ Set up honeypots + SIEM alerting
6. ⏳ Run red-team prompt injection test

### Short-Term

- Replace `**KMS_SIGNER**` with actual KMS/HSM integration
- Implement production sandbox (nsjail/gVisor)
- Configure CORS origins for production
- Implement DID registry lookup
- Add more comprehensive test coverage
- Set up monitoring dashboards

### Long-Term

- Kubernetes manifests with PodSecurity
- Nginx/Envoy policy for mTLS
- GitHub Action for adversarial prompt tests
- Regular red-team exercises
- Quarterly security audits

---

## Integration Points

### Agents → Gatekeeper

All agents should route privileged actions through Gatekeeper:
- DVA (Dynamic Verification Agent)
- OAA (Orchestrated Agent Architecture)
- Reflections workers
- Any agent making tool calls

### Gatekeeper → Services

Gatekeeper brokers calls to:
- Civic Ledger (attestations)
- GIC Indexer (GI scores)
- Sentinels (consensus)
- Execution sandboxes

---

## Security Posture

### Defense in Depth

1. **Layer 1**: DID signature verification
2. **Layer 2**: GI floor checks
3. **Layer 3**: RBAC enforcement
4. **Layer 4**: Injection detection
5. **Layer 5**: DelibProof consensus
6. **Layer 6**: Sandboxed execution
7. **Layer 7**: Immutable attestations

### Fail-Closed Defaults

- Invalid signatures → Block
- GI < 0.95 → Block
- Missing RBAC → Block
- Injection detected → Block
- Consensus failed → Block
- Sentinel errors → Block (fail closed)

---

## Testing
