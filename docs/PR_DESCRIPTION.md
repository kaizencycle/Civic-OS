# Pull Request: Ceremonial Summons Protocol (Dead Man's Switch)

## 🔥 Overview

This PR implements the **Ceremonial Summons** - a dead man's switch that ensures Kaizen OS outlives its creator.

If Michael and all 7 founding agents (AUREA, ATLAS, SOLARA, JADE, EVE, ZEUS, HERMES) go dormant for 90+ consecutive days, the system automatically:

1. Elevates the hidden Master README to the repository root
2. Notifies the community via GitHub issue and Discord
3. Initiates custodianship succession
4. Ensures the work continues

**This is not failure planning. This is immortality architecture.**

---

## 🎯 The Problem This Solves

Every revolutionary project faces the "Bus Factor":
- Creator dies → Project dies
- Creator burns out → Project abandoned  
- Creator gets captured → Project corrupted
- Creator becomes tyrant → Community fractures

**Kaizen OS refuses to have a single point of failure.**

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. **Ceremonial Summons Document**
- **Location (dormant):** `ledger/.sealed/MASTER_README.md`
- **Location (active):** `README.md` (root)
- **Purpose:** Complete custodianship guide for succession
- **Trigger:** Activated when all 8 entities dormant for 90+ days

#### 2. **Kaizen Guardian (Dormancy Detection)**
- **Location:** `scripts/ceremonial_summons/kaizen_guardian.py`
- **Function:** Monitors activity across 8 entities daily
- **Checks:**
  - GitHub commits, issues, PRs for @kaizencycle
  - API calls to Lab endpoints (AUREA, ATLAS, SOLARA)
  - Ledger signatures (JADE, EVE, ZEUS, HERMES)
- **Output:** Activity logs, elevation triggers

#### 3. **GitHub Actions Workflow**
- **Location:** `.github/workflows/guardian.yml`
- **Schedule:** Daily at 00:00 UTC
- **Actions:**
  - Run dormancy check
  - Elevate README if threshold exceeded
  - Create notification issue
  - Send Discord alert (if configured)
  - Archive activity logs

## 🚀 Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Seal the Master README (Day 1)

```bash
# 1. Create sealed directory
mkdir -p ledger/.sealed

# 2. Move Ceremonial Summons document to sealed location
cp CEREMONIAL_SUMMONS.md ledger/.sealed/MASTER_README.md

# 3. Ensure it's hidden from casual browsing
echo "ledger/.sealed/" >> .gitignore  # Optional - or keep it visible but sealed

# 4. Commit
git add ledger/.sealed/MASTER_README.md
git commit -m "🔒 Seal Master README for Ceremonial Summons"
git push
```

### Phase 2: Deploy Guardian (Day 1)

```bash
# 1. Create scripts directory
mkdir -p scripts/ceremonial_summons

# 2. Copy guardian script
cp kaizen_guardian.py scripts/ceremonial_summons/

# 3. Make executable
chmod +x scripts/ceremonial_summons/kaizen_guardian.py

# 4. Test locally
cd scripts/ceremonial_summons
python kaizen_guardian.py --check

# 5. Commit
git add scripts/ceremonial_summons/
git commit -m "🔍 Deploy Kaizen Guardian (dormancy detection)"
git push
```

### Phase 3: Configure GitHub Actions (Day 1)

```bash
# 1. Create workflow directory
mkdir -p .github/workflows

# 2. Copy workflow file
cp github_workflow_guardian.yml .github/workflows/guardian.yml

# 3. Configure secrets in GitHub repository settings:
#    - OPENAI_LAB_ENDPOINT (optional)
#    - ANTHROPIC_LAB_ENDPOINT (optional)
#    - DEEPSEEK_LAB_ENDPOINT (optional)
#    - CIVIC_LEDGER_ENDPOINT (optional)
#    - DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL (optional, for notifications)

# 4. Commit
git add .github/workflows/guardian.yml
git commit -m "⚙️ Configure automated Guardian monitoring"
git push

# 5. Verify workflow appears in GitHub Actions tab
```

### Phase 4: Create Custodian Guide (Day 2)

```bash
# Create comprehensive custodianship documentation
touch docs/CUSTODIAN_GUIDE.md

# Content should include:
# - How to verify legitimacy
# - How to take the Custodian Oath
# - How to activate the community
# - How to implement the 7 Labs
# - How to prepare your successor

# Commit
git add docs/CUSTODIAN_GUIDE.md
git commit -m "📖 Create Custodian Guide for succession"
git push
```

### Phase 5: Test the System (Day 2)

```bash
# 1. Test dormancy detection locally
python scripts/ceremonial_summons/kaizen_guardian.py --check

# 2. Test forced activation (in a separate test branch)
git checkout -b test-ceremonial-summons
python scripts/ceremonial_summons/kaizen_guardian.py --activate

# 3. Verify:
#    - README.md appears at root
#    - Elevation log created
#    - Git commit made

# 4. Clean up test
git checkout main
git branch -D test-ceremonial-summons
```

### Phase 6: Announce to Community (Day 3)

Create a blog post / announcement explaining:
- What the Ceremonial Summons is
- Why it exists (immortality architecture)
- How it works (90-day dormancy → automatic succession)
- What this means for the project (cannot be killed)

---

## 📊 Monitoring

### Activity Logs

**Location:** `ledger/guardian/activity_log.json`

Tracks daily activity checks for all 8 entities. Example:

```json
{
  "checks": [
    {
      "timestamp": "2025-10-29T00:00:00Z",
      "all_dormant": false,
      "entities": [
        {
          "name": "Michael (@kaizencycle)",
          "is_active": true,
          "last_activity": "2025-10-28T15:30:00Z",
          "days_dormant": 0
        },
        // ... 7 more entities
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Elevation Logs

**Location:** `ledger/guardian/elevation_log.json`

Records Ceremonial Summons activations. Example:

```json
{
  "elevations": [
    {
      "timestamp": "2026-02-15T00:00:00Z",
      "event": "ceremonial_summons_activated",
      "reason": "90_day_dormancy_exceeded",
      "entity_status": { /* full activity snapshot */ }
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🎭 The Philosophy

This implementation embodies the three core principles:

### 改善 (Kaizen) - Continuous Improvement
- Guardian runs daily, checking incrementally
- Logs preserved for historical analysis
- System improves through iteration

### 召唤 (Summon) - The Calling Forth  
- Ceremonial Summons document calls forth custodians
- GitHub issue invites community participation
- Discord alert reaches existing community

### 金繕い (Kintsugi) - Golden Repair
- Creator's departure is the breaking
- Custodianship is the golden repair
- The succession makes the project more beautiful (more resilient) than before

**Together: "We heal as we walk."**

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### This Is NOT a Backup System

The Ceremonial Summons does not:
- Create repository forks automatically
- Archive code elsewhere
- Transfer ownership forcibly

**It only:** Elevates documentation and calls for succession.

### This Is NOT Reversible (By Design)

Once the Master README is elevated:
- It cannot be "un-elevated" automatically
- The custodianship process has begun
- The community must decide next steps

**This is intentional.** No single person (including the creator) should be able to stop succession.

### This Requires Human Agency

The system can:
- ✅ Detect dormancy
- ✅ Elevate documentation  
- ✅ Send notifications

The system cannot:
- ❌ Force someone to become Custodian
- ❌ Automatically implement Labs
- ❌ Make governance decisions

**Human custodians must still answer the召唤.**

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### Phase 2 (Optional Future Work)

- [ ] Multi-platform monitoring (GitLab, SourceHut mirrors)
- [ ] Automated repository forks to trusted custodians
- [ ] Smart contract-based elevation (on-chain governance)
- [ ] Multi-signature custodianship (requires 3/5 custodians to make changes)
- [ ] Retroactive activity verification (check historical logs for patterns)

---

## 📜 The Custodian Oath (Preview)

When someone accepts custodianship, they take this oath:

> *"I, [Your Name], accept custodianship of Kaizen OS.*
> 
> *I swear to:*
> - *Uphold the Custos Charter*
> - *Serve the commons, not myself*
> - *Maintain the CC0 license (no privatization ever)*
> - *Pass the torch when my time comes*
> - *Build in public, govern in the open*
> 
> *I am not the owner. I am the steward.*
> 
> *I accept this burden. I will carry it well.*
> 
> *Signed and sealed: [Date]"*

## 🎯 Success Criteria

This PR is successful if:

1. ✅ Guardian successfully detects dormancy across 8 entities
2. ✅ Master README remains sealed until 90-day threshold
3. ✅ Elevation occurs automatically when threshold exceeded
4. ✅ Community receives clear notification
5. ✅ Custodianship documentation is complete and accessible
6. ✅ System operates autonomously (no manual intervention required)

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

This design draws inspiration from:

- **Bitcoin's Difficulty Adjustment** (autonomous, no governance required)
- **Ethereum's Smart Contracts** (code is law, no human override)
- **Dead Man's Switches** (trigger on absence, not presence)
- **Kintsugi Philosophy** (break with beauty, repair with gold)
- **Open Source Licensing** (CC0 ensures perpetual forkability)

## 🔥 Final Words

**This is not morbid planning. This is immortality architecture.**

Every great project must answer the question: *"What happens when I'm gone?"*

- Linux answered it: Linus stepped back, Torvalds still exists, but Linux Foundation governs
- Wikipedia answered it: Jimmy Wales is not Wikipedia; the community is
- Bitcoin answered it: Satoshi disappeared; Bitcoin continues

**Kaizen OS answers it NOW, not later.**

The Ceremonial Summons ensures:
- No single point of failure
- No bus factor
- No irreplaceable founders
- Only an eternal relay of stewards

**This is how we build systems that outlive us.**

*"No master. No savior. Only stewards passing the torch."*
